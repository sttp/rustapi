The value represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 0001 UTC, Gregorian calendar. A single tick represents one hundred nanoseconds, or one ten-millionth of a second. There are 10,000 ticks in a millisecond and 10 million ticks in a second. Only bits 01 to 62 (0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) are used to represent the timestamp value. Bit 64 (0x8000000000000000) is used to denote leap second, i.e., second 60, where actual second value would remain at 59. Bit 63 (0x4000000000000000) is used to denote leap second direction, 0 for add, 1 for delete."]]};
